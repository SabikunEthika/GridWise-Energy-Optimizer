# GridWise-Energy-Optimizer: Smart Campus Energy Optimization API

## 1. Project Overview

GridWise is a REST API for intelligent 24-hour campus energy scheduling. It accepts hourly demand, solar generation, electricity tariffs, battery specifications, and one to three natural-language operator notes.

The service interprets operator notes into supported energy directives, solves a cost-minimization Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), and independently validates the resulting schedule before returning it.

The project was developed for the BUP CSE Fest 2026 GridWise Challenge by team Kronos.

The optimizer enforces demand balance, solar availability, battery capacity, charge/discharge limits, directive constraints, and end-of-day battery neutrality.

## 3. Technology Stack

- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Pydantic v2
- Google Gemini through google-genai
- PuLP with the COIN-OR CBC solver
- Pytest and HTTPX
- Docker and Docker Compose

## 4. Setup & Installation

Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/SabikunEthika/GridWise-BUP-2026.git
cd GridWise-BUP-2026
~~~

Create and activate a virtual environment.

Windows PowerShell:

~~~powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
~~~

Git Bash:

~~~bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
~~~

Install dependencies:

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
~~~

## 5. Environment Variables

Copy the environment template:

~~~bash
cp .env.example .env
~~~

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|---|---|---:|---|
| LLM_PROVIDER | LLM provider | gemini | No |
| GEMINI_API_KEY | Google Gemini API key | empty | Optional when fallback is available |
| LLM_MODEL | Gemini model name | gemini-3.5-flash-lite | No |
| PORT | HTTP server port | 8000 locally | No |

Never commit .env or API keys to the repository.

## 6. LLM Provider & Model

The configured LLM provider is Google Gemini. The deployed service uses gemini-3.5-flash-lite; the model name can be changed with LLM_MODEL. Gemini supports structured outputs for this model, which is required for directive interpretation.

If Gemini is unavailable and the checked-out version includes the fallback interpreter, the service uses deterministic rule-based interpretation instead.

## 7. LLM Role in Directive Interpretation

The LLM interprets natural-language operator notes and maps each note to exactly one supported directive:

- solar_reduction
- minimum_battery_reserve
- no_charge_window
- no_discharge_window
- max_grid_window
- no_op

The LLM does not directly create the energy schedule. It only produces structured directive data. Guardrails validate that data before it reaches the optimizer.

## 8. Guardrails & Validation

Guardrails validate directive types, hours, numeric values, supported fields, note ordering, and battery-related limits. The final-plan validator independently checks:

- Exactly 24 ordered hours
- Non-negative and finite energy values
- Solar usage within effective solar availability
- Battery capacity and minimum reserve requirements
- Charge/discharge rate limits
- No-charge and no-discharge windows
- Maximum grid-import windows
- Hourly energy balance
- End-of-day battery neutrality

The API uses this error contract:

| Status | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| 200 | Successful health or optimization response |
| 400 | Malformed JSON or structurally invalid request |
| 422 | Semantically invalid request or infeasible optimization |
| 500 | Controlled internal validation or server error |

## 9. Optimization Approach / Solver

The optimizer uses PuLP to formulate a 24-hour MILP and CBC to solve it. The model minimizes total grid electricity cost while enforcing:

- Grid, solar, charge, and discharge energy balance
- Solar availability limits
- Battery state transitions
- Battery capacity and reserve limits
- Binary charge/discharge mode selection
- Operator directive constraints
- Final battery energy equal to initial battery energy

## 10. API Endpoints

### GET /health

Returns:

~~~json
{"status": "ok"}
~~~

### POST /optimize-energy

Accepts an energy scenario and returns a validated schedule. Interactive documentation is available at /docs when the server is running.

## 11. API Request & Response Examples

The repository includes a complete valid request at data/sample_01_request.json.

~~~bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/optimize-energy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @data/sample_01_request.json
~~~

Successful response fields include:

~~~json
{
  "scenario_id": "SAMPLE-01",
  "directive_interpretation": [],
  "hourly_plan": [],
  "total_grid_kwh": 2692.5,
  "total_cost_bdt": 38365.0,
  "peak_grid_kwh": 175.0,
  "plan_summary": "Generated a valid 24-hour energy schedule..."
}
~~~

The actual hourly_plan contains 24 entries. Equivalent optimal schedules may differ in their hourly actions while remaining mathematically valid.

## 12. How to Run Locally

Start the development server:

~~~bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
~~~

Open these URLs:

- Health check: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
- Interactive API documentation: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

## 13. How to Test

Run the complete test suite:

~~~bash
pytest tests/ -v
~~~

Run the official public sample tests:

~~~bash
pytest tests/test_official_samples.py -v
~~~

The public benchmark data is stored in data/public_sample_cases.json.

## 14. Docker Setup & Usage

Build and start the service with Docker Compose:

~~~bash
docker compose up --build
~~~

Or build and run the image directly:

~~~bash
docker build -t gridwise-api:latest .
docker run --rm -p 8000:10000 --env-file .env gridwise-api:latest
~~~

Verify the container:

~~~bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
~~~

## 15. Public Deployment

The application can be deployed as a Docker web service on Render or another container-hosting platform.

Required deployment settings:

- Runtime: Docker
- Bind host: 0.0.0.0
- Health check path: /health
- Environment variables: GEMINI_API_KEY, LLM_MODEL, and PORT

After deployment, the public URLs will be:

~~~text
https://gridwise-bup-2026-i1n0.onrender.com/health
https://gridwise-bup-2026-i1n0.onrender.com/docs
~~~

Submission deployment URL:

~~~text
https://gridwise-bup-2026-i1n0.onrender.com/docs
~~~

## 16. Sample Test Cases / Results

The official sample pack contains ten public cases, SAMPLE-01 through SAMPLE-10, in data/public_sample_cases.json.

For SAMPLE-01, the expected directive interpretation includes:

~~~json
{
  "directive_type": "solar_reduction",
  "hours": [12, 13],
  "factor": 0.25
}
~~~

The unrelated second note should be classified as no_op. Reference metrics are:

~~~text
total_grid_kwh: 2692.5
total_cost_bdt: 38365.0
peak_grid_kwh: 175.0
~~~

The returned plan is valid when it satisfies all physical, directive, and accounting constraints. It does not need to match the reference action sequence byte-for-byte.

## 17. Dependencies

Runtime and testing dependencies are listed in requirements.txt:

- fastapi
- uvicorn
- pydantic
- python-dotenv
- google-genai
- pulp
- pytest
- httpx

The Docker image also installs the COIN-OR CBC system solver.

## 18. Limitations

- The planning horizon is exactly 24 one-hour periods.
- Hours must be supplied in ascending order from 0 to 23.
- Grid export is not modeled; unused solar is curtailed.
- Battery energy must return to its initial value at hour 23.
- Contradictory or physically infeasible directives are rejected.
- Gemini interpretation quality depends on the configured model and API availability; the deterministic fallback is used when supported by the current implementation.
